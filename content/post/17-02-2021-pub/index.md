We propose a prediction for the intensity of water circulation in subglacial lakes, which can maintain microorganisms and sediments suspended in the water column, in agreement with field results from lake Vostok, Antarctica. This work is the result of a fruitful collaboration with Martin Siegert from Imperial College London. The picture, which made the cover (!), shows the Ellsworth mountain range in Antarctica (with subglacial lake Ellsworth lurking somewhere 3km below the ice) and was taken by Peter Bucktrout from the British Antarctic Survey.
